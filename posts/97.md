Sunday.

Some Recursers (RCers? Hackers? People?) planned an Eastover potluck brunch at the Recurse Center. I attended and it was a blast. After eating a lot of delcious food, a few of us played [Werewolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%!p(MISSING)arty_game%!)(MISSING) for like six hours. It was a nice break from thinking about computers.
