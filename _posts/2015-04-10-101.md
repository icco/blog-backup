Another day, more feelings of unproductive-ness. Started the day with a nice walk from north of NYU. Got lost wandering among the store fronts.
 
Once I got in, I attempted to fix archives page to order correctly, but failed. I did build a simple [stats page](/stats) though, so that was nice.

After lunch, I did [a code kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_%!p(MISSING)rogramming%!)(MISSING) with Karthik as my partner. Todays kata was [anagrams](http://codekata.com/kata/kata06-anagrams/). We were able [to complete it successfully](https://gist.github.com/icco/187b9f49b0230c56811d) which was nice. I haven't paired with anyone yet, so this was a nice way to work with someone and learn some stuff.

On Thursdays, RC lets people present what they've been working on. This weeks presentations had a lot of interesting things in them, and made me want to look into the following things:

 - http://voxeljs.com/
 - http://nwjs.io/
 - Writing a simple web spider and injestion pipeline.
 - Going through [my pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:icco) or [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12680-nat) and figure out some sort of data about my reading history.
