My friend @alexbaldwin has been telling me to do this for a long time, and I figure it is time to bite the bullet.

I'm going to start offering what he always calls "DevOps Super Friends" or more plainly: "Site Reliability Engineer Office Hours".

The idea is simple: I have created an email mailing list, and I'll send out announcements for office hour signups. You can book 30 minute increments, and I'll do any of the following over hangouts:

 - code reviews
 - architecture reviews
 - Advice on deployment tools, scaling, monitoring or alerting
 - Interview Practice
 - Talking about anything else that you think is "DevOps", "Site Reliability Engineering" or "Software Reconnaissance Engineering".

This is just an experiment, so please signup and I'll email out office hours in the next few days!
