The Apple TV has [been hacked](http://www.appletvhacks.net/2007/04/01/mac-os-x-running-on-apple-tv/). You can now run the full mac OSX on it, plus enable USB and add functionality to [frontrow](http://www.appletvhacks.net/2007/04/02/create-plugins-for-backrow/) You can even [enable SSH](http://www.appletvhacks.net/2007/03/24/enable-ssh-and-afp-on-your-apple-tv/).

But what is making this whole thing amazing is the fact that [Apple doesn't care](http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/05/apple-not-fighting-back-against-apple-tv-hacks/). I mean there have been a lot of smart and dumb moves in terms of hacking hardware, and this is definitely one of the smarter ones. I feel that this device may flop, but still it has potential.

And while this is all very cool, what is the best news is that companies are starting to release [unencrypted versions of their songs on the iTunes music store.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/technology/03music.html?_r=1&oref=slogin) Possible in a response to [Steve Jobs letter](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/) proclaiming the DRM music was the reason for low sales of music. I am really excited for this, because the more open standards, the more chances we have.
