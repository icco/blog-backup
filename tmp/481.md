One thing I hate is missing the fact that Cal Poly is evolving. There are lots of places on campus that I never see due to the large amount of time I spend cooped up in the lab, so last weekend I went around and took some photos of the current state of campus. Some interesting developments is that they redid the soccer fields out on the edge of campus. Also I never noticed the sweet graffiti in the Architecture building.

To see how the campus has looked over the last three years through my eyes, check out my [calpoly tag on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/tags/calpoly/).
