After listening to [Reply All #61](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/61-baby-king/), I decided it was time to re-look into [Genius Web Annotations](http://genius.com/web-annotator). I've enabled their javascript on every post. Give it a try.

Update: I followed this up with some tweets, because this javascript injects a lot into my site.
