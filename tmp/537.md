What's making me [#happy](/tag/happy)? [Pocket Mortys](http://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/13/pocket-mortys-game-app-store/)! Thanks [@staringispolite](https://twitter.com/staringispolite) for the find. It's like a simplified version of Pokemon featuring [Rick and Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty).

I've loved most of Adele's late night appearances, and [Adele Carpool Karaoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nck6BZga7TQ&feature=youtu.be) is no exception.

I enjoyed clicking through [The Catalog](http://onuniverse.com/cards/2819) on [Universe](http://onuniverse.com/).

[A Tale of Twenty-Two Million Citi Bikes](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/a-tale-of-twenty-two-million-citi-bikes-analyzing-the-nyc-bike-share-system/) is a fantastic piece on how CitiBike works inside NYC.

The various tributes and memories people have been posting about [Alan Rickman](http://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/daniel-radcliffe-tribute-to-alan-rickman#.veldOzWMB)  
and [David Bowie](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/12092542/Bowies-last-album-was-parting-gift-for-fans-in-carefully-planned-finale.html). While incredibly sad news, fans paying tribute always brings a smile to my face.

And "[Japan Keeps The Defunct Kami-Shirataki Train Station Open for Just One High-School Girl](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/01/japan-keeps-this-defunct-train-station-running-for-just-one-passenger/423273/)" made me incredibly happy.

Finally, it's [Wikipedia's 15th Birthday](https://15.wikipedia.org), and I've really loved reading all the outpouring of love for the fantastic website.

Have a great one.
