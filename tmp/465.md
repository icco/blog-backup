So I've been a little slow to write this, mainly due to the fact that I've been having trouble catching up on sleep. But two weekends ago, I had an amazing weekend, because I spent the weekend at PAX in Seattle. Now I should have cool and interesting reveiw of PAX, but now two weeks later it doesnt look like it's gonna happen. Why? because [I have NADD](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html).

here are some good reviews though:

[PAX at Slashdot](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/25/1658206&from=pseudoweb.net)

[Ars Technica's PostÂ ](http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/pax-technica-looking-back-at-penny-arcade-expo-2007.ars/1)

I'll post some pictures eventually too.

p.s. read the article I linked to on Nerd Attention Deficit Disorder (NADD). It describes me so well it's scary.
