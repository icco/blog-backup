Trying to lock down a morning routine has been really hard. I would say, borderline impossible for me. But I keep hearing about all of the benefits having consistency in the morning. So I'm going to keep trying to stick to a routine in the morning.

After reading this, I'd love to hear what you do in the morning. Share with me on twitter at [@icco](https://twitter.com/icco) or by email at [nat@natwelch.com](mailto:nat@natwelch.com).

Since 2016 started, I've been trying to have this routine:

*   0645: Alarm goes off, get out of bed. No laptop time.
*   0645 - 0730: Stretch, bathroom, drink a glass of water.
*   0730 - 0830: Make breakfast, read news.
*   0830 - 0930: Shower, get dressed, pack backpack.
*   0930: Go to work.

If I'm lucky, I'll run into this great musician on the train platform:

And maybe some day I'll put a run somewhere in that timeline.
