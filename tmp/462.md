What's this? My favorite Genre, Author, and state of mind, all in one post? Hurrah!

Ok, I discovered a wonderful thing last year, right before the infamous wipe of my archives. This wonderful thing was a new Gibson book. I was so happy in my discovery I created [a Wikipedia post on it](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spook_Country&oldid=80331232), and then forgot about it. Right before [Harry Potter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225?ie=UTF8&tag=pseudoweb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0545010225)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0545010225) premiered, I checked up on [the article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook_Country), only to find it was coming out a few days later. Huzzah!

But at the same time I had started my internship at Adobe, and thus it slipped again from my memory. Thankfully though, [Michael Heilemann](http://binarybonsai.com/ "who writes a great blog, btw") showed me the light, when I stumbled [across his post](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2007/07/25/gibson-on/). Praise the gods, [Spook Country](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399154302?ie=UTF8&tag=pseudoweb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0399154302)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0399154302) has been released and I will be going to buy it tomorrow.

So yes, That is my first piece of consumerwhoreism. Also tomorrow I will in theory be ordering my new computer, and possibly picking up some manga. Basically I will be left overjoyed, and my bank account will be crying like a rape victim.

But enough of my bad analogies and metaphors. If you haven't read any of Gibson's work, I highly recommend his writing. The best three books that he has written so far I believe are [Neuromancer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441569595?ie=UTF8&tag=pseudoweb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0441569595)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0441569595), [Burning Chrome](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060539828?ie=UTF8&tag=pseudoweb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060539828)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0060539828), and [Pattern Recognition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425198685?ie=UTF8&tag=pseudoweb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0425198685)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0425198685).

In other news, my server is running like a drunk fat twelve year old. Needless to say, all of my sites are suffering from his choice to break the law and drink. No alcohol on the job kid!
