So I was reading [John's Post](http://johnbknight.blogspot.com/2008/10/definitive-plan.html "The Knight Writer: The Definitive Plan") and I started to think about my life plan. Needless to say, it's not really a plan, but more of an idea. This idea being "make others happy, be happy, and stay happy."

I've tried writing this post a few different ways, but I think John's little list got me to at least make my own list, so I can avoid writing the epic novel that would be my outlook on life (not to mention the fact that it's ever changing...). But none the less, john made a list, so I figured I would make a list.

This list is not in order in any sort.

*   Develop a web-application that is used by 10,000 people
*   Get my name in the credits of some piece of art (not sure if I want to include software as art, if so I've done this, more on that later...)
*   Eat
*   Sleep
*   Hike the John Muir Trail
*   Live in Boston
*   Live in Europe
*   Visit Japan
*   Turn 21
*   Be Happy
*   Volunteer
*   Become a Teacher
*   Visit every National Forest in the USA

Anyway, that's my list. What's your list?
