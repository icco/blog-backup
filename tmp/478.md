I just read an amazing article on [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/) titled ["I,Gamer"](http://kotaku.com/5097355/i-gamer).

This article really spoke to me, because I find more often than not, I am more interested in the community behind a topic or trend then I do the actual topic/trend. It's not that I don't enjoy and love said topic, because otherwise I would never have initially gotten involved with the community.

Some examples of things this has happened:

Linux: first [NBLUG](http://nblug.org/) then [CPLUG](http://cplug.org/)

[World of WarCraft](http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Gorgonnash&n=Icco): The diversity of people, guilds, and the forums. I'm more of a watcher of this community, mainly because I'm not nearly as hardcore as most, but I enjoy the culture non-the-less.

[Jedi Knight II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Knight_2): O how I loved this game, in fact it's probably the game that got me hooked on FPS, and I never beat it. Want to know what happened? I fell in love with [The Jedi Academy](http://thejediacademy.net/). This was an amazing place that promoted teaching others cool things in the game. In my mind it was basically a never ending online Bar Camp.

Web 2.0/Social Media: [Bar Camps](http://barcamp.org/), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/icco), the whole community behind it. Here's to someday maybe getting invited to [FooCamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp).

[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/): This is what actually got me hooked on Web 2.0. Back when 1.2 hit I spent a lot of time on the [plugin forums](http://wordpress.org/support/forum/10) learning about [PHP](http://php.net/) and helping others.

Case Modding/Computer Hardware: Let's not even talk about this. I was very active in a few communities, namely [Hardware Geeks](http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/), but I visited and posted on probably around 20 different forums and followed around 50 different blogs.

There have been a few other communities I've been active in, namely [MegaTokyo](http://www.megatokyo.com/) and [Penny-Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com/),Â  but my involvement there is similar to my involvement to WoW. I follow what happens in the community, but I rarely participate.

Anyways, I'd like to end with a quote from the article:

> "it's not because we're gamers. It's not even because we're hardcore gamers. It's because we're such fanatical culturalists that we forget about the middle ground."
