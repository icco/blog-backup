So you know what my favorite web 2.0 website is? [Last.FM](http://last.fm "Last.FM") of course.

They recently pushed their beta site design live, and it's beautiful. I've been using it to listen to music at work which has been amazing. I enjoy it more than [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/), mainly because it isn't so ad heavy.

My history with [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) is strange to say the least. I started using their services back when they were [AudioScrobbler](http://www.audioscrobbler.net/). I really liked the concept of the data collection they were doing. They logged every song I listened to on my computer, on multiple media players. Since then the site has been was merged into [Last.FM](http://Last.FM) and I've loved it ever since.

Some of the features [Last.FM](http://Last.FM) has added recently I really like:

*   iPod Scrobbling (they track the music I listen to on my iPod as well as my computer)
*   Full Tracks, not just the 30 second clips they used to have
*   [A powerful API.](http://build.last.fm/) There used to be a decent [API from AudioScroble](http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/)r, but it has since been upgraded by Last.FM and they have added a cool app gallery.

The app gallery should really be highlighted here. Mainly because it allows access to historical data of what you have been listening to for a long period of time (four years for me I think).

Anyway, check [Last.FM](http://Last.FM) out if you haven't already. If you want to add me as a friend or see my musical tastes, it is located here.

Happy Weekend,
