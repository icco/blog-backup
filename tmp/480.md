Well today we ushered in a new era. I'm not sure exactly what I want to say about this, except that President Obama's Inaugural Address was beautiful, as was the inaugural poem. I have stolen the New York Times transcriptions of these for safe keeping, but I'm going to publish my copies here.

Finally the above image was grabbed off of Flickr, which has a great pool of photo's from the event.
