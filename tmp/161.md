Only 22 days left in NYC! Weird.

On Wednesday I read two articles on burnout. Considering I very much felt burnt out when I left my previous job, it was nice to see that other people had gone through similar mental pathways.

I talked with April about Boggle and Python dictionaries. I learned a few things, which was nice.

I went for a few walks, I just wasn't feeling like coding. In the evening I had ramen with Jeanne and Sarah. So delicious, so much fun.
