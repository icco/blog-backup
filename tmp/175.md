I got a haircut! And a shave!

It was raining for most of the day, so I kept it pretty mellow. I did add code coloring to my blog though.

I keep a [geojson](http://geojson.org/) file describing where I have lived for more than a cumulative month of my life. It includes most offices and places I've considered home, although I keep remembering stuff I am missing. Github lets [you embed geojson in pages and autorenders it for you](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/). So this is my map as of Saturday afternoon.
