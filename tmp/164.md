Yesterday (Tuesday), I started reading ["The Magicians"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6101718-the-magicians). I got lost in the book today. It's pretty good Fantasy.

I'm trying to get my sleep schedule back on track, but haven't quite succeeded, I still need an alarm to get to RC ontime.

In the morning, I went through a bunch of recent photos and cleaned them up and archived them.

During the day, when I wasn't reading, I slowly moved my blog over to [tachyons](http://tachyons.io/). I'm not sure if I'm happy with the new layout (it's very close to the same), but at the very least it's simpler from a code standpoint.

My blog used to look like:

Now it looks like:

I went to dinner and drinks in the evening with a good friend from London, Josh. Josh is a reminder that I don't keep in touch with everyone I want to. This was the first time I had talked to him since I left London, and I felt like a bit of a jerk because of that.

p.s. My blog isn't getting archived by [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)... and I have no idea why.
