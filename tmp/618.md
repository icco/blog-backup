It's been a weird week, but time continues to pass. Thirty days until polls being to close. Another week down. Time for some [#happy](/tag/happy) stuff.

First off, this tweet by [@gwern](https://twitter.com/gwern) killed me. It's actually something I've been thinking about. I know they were being satirical, but still, totally something I want to exist.

[@hunterwalk](https://twitter.com/hunterwalk) stopped by the office briefly and we talked about startups, his time at Youtube and other stuff. At some point he took a photo of me which I didn't even notice.

I binged a bunch Tiny Desk concerts:

*   [Miguel: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7w0-KgZMdY&feature=youtu.be)
*   [The Internet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6j49uzPugA&feature=youtu.be)
*   [Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ferZnZ0_rSM&feature=youtu.be)
*   [Blue Man Group: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTJfITfbYNA&feature=youtu.be)
*   [Common: Tiny Desk Concert At The White House](http://www.npr.org/2016/10/03/496433228/common-tiny-desk-concert-at-the-white-house)

[Vice President Biden and Adam Devine Go Undercover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta4TnWVEqic&feature=youtu.be) was both funny, and sobering.

[Pixel by Google](https://madeby.google.com/phone/specs/) is a pretty cool phone. [The Light Phone](http://www.thelightphone.com/#getthelightphone) is a totally different phone, but also cool.

Have a great week!
